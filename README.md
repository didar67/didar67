Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Didarul Islam

I'm a Cloud Automation enthusiast, currently learning Python scripting, Linux (Ubuntu & Red Hat), Git, and GitHub.
My journey includes building real-world Cloud automation projects by effectively combining these technologies.

I'm also exploring cron jobs, Bash scripting, GitHub Actions, and AWS to become job-ready for remote Cloud Automation opportunities.

I'm passionate about continuous learning and gaining hands-on experience through practical projects.
